# PyTorch

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library,used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.

A number of pieces of Deep Learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla, Uber's Pyro, HuggingFace's Transformers, and Catalyst.

PyTorch provides two high-level features:

* Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
* Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system

PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable Nvidia GPU. PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.
